# Static File Serving

Aleph.js will serve any static files in the `public` directory. Files inside the `public` directory can then be referenced by your code by using the base URL (`/`).

For example, if you add an image `public/logo.png`, the following code will access the image:

```jsx
import React from "https://esm.sh/react";

export default function Logo() {
  return <img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />;
}
```

You can aslo serve other static assets such as:

- `favicon.ico`
- `manifest.json`
- `robots.txt`
- Google Site Verification, etc
